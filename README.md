## Introduction

Puzzles can often be complicated. Props robust where only the biggest of brains prevail. But you have followed the path to the ultimate end point--the source code. Will you quickly find the next step? Or will security through obscurity be your undoing?

## Let The Big Brains of DOD Show Their Skill!

The actual code is located in the Puzzleforprizes folder as puzzleforprizes.ino; if you want to load the code yourself, you will need both the folder and the ino file to load the sketch into the Arduino Development Enviornment. But that is not required to solve this puzzle at all. Keep your eyes open and you will reach the finish line. To reach the code click on the folder 'Puzzlesforprizes' and then select 'puzzlesforprizes.ino'. You can download everything with the green code button and followed by selecting 'Download Zip'.
